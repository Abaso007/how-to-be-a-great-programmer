# Your time is worth something

Programmers love to think about optimizing code. Should we use `.forEach()` or `for()`? What's the Big-O of this algorithm?

I tend to value a programmer's time as more scarce than money. It's hard to hire great programmers so the bottleneck of a company's R&D is usually time, not money.

Therefore I gladly pay double price for cloud servers and focus on _usecase_ instead of _optimizated code_.

Code readibility also plays a big role here. Prefer to write [simple code](keep-it-simple.md) that's easy for another developer to contribute to.
