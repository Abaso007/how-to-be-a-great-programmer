# Hierarchy is everything

I strongly believe that the smartest people share only one trait: they understand that **everything is hierarchy**.

The most important skill to have is to traverse this tree-structure in your mind.

Let's take a school for example. You're one of many students in a class. You have one teacher.

| | Teacher | |
|---|---|---|
| Student | Student | Student |

But from the teacher's perspective, he's just one of many teachers. He has one director to report to, though.

| | | | Director | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | Teacher | | | | Teacher | |
| Student | Student | Student | | Student | Student | Student |

Our world is full of hierarchies. They're either one-to-one, one-to-many or many-to-many.
