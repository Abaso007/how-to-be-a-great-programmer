# Code can be Finished

* Many open source projects don't get any traction and die.
* Some open source projects get traction and get used a lot.
  * Many of them keep growing and accepting PRs until they're bloated and die.
  * Some of them are marked _finished_ and don't have activity for years.
  
I always pick the latter ones. They're battle tested and I trust the author that he isn't going to break stuff by adding nonsense methods for a minority.

Repositories with a working solution for a clear goal that haven't had commits in years aren't _dead_. They're _done_. And I'd trust them with my life.
