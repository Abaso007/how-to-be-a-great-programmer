# Pick quality dependencies

Develop a feeling of quality when choosing dependencies for your project. Most often the perfect tool for your project isn't the right choice.

I'd always choose a battle-tested framework or library that solves 95% of my problem than some new tool still figuring out its place in the universe.

Once a tool has reached a certain maturity and you feel it's here to stay, only then depend on it in your project.

Learn to trust your guy on these kind of decisions. Great complex dependencies often come with many maintainers, a great readme with status badges, a logo, documentation on a separate website and great examples. Or they're [done](code-can-be-done.md).

It helps to follow in these cases. Your own product is unique, let the parts of it be standard.
